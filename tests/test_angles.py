"""
USER STORY / TASK MAPPING (User Story 1):
- Perform unit testing

OBJECTIVE:
- Validate correctness and numerical stability of the core feature-math utilities (e.g., pose normalization/stabilization, joint angle calculations).
- Ensure deterministic, correct outputs for known geometric inputs before building larger ML pipeline stages on top.

LIBRARIES USED:
- pytest: provides the test runner and assertion framework for automated unit testing.
- numpy: used to define deterministic vector/point inputs and validate computed outputs (including edge cases and floating-point stability).
